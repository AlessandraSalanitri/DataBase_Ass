This report illustrates the creation, testing and deployed proof of concept data-driven full stack web-application.  
The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where:
Models (Products, User ) represent data structures,
Views are rendered using EJS templates (*.ejs files in the views directory),
Controllers handle the application logic and interact with models and views to process requests and generate responses.
It also demonstrates CRUD operations on MongoDB database.
CURD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
